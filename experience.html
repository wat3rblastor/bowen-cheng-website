                I am motivated to learn as much as possible about all areas of Computer Science.
                This led me to obtain a wide breadth of experience, including working on AI systems, data ingestion
                pipelines, distributed systems, embedded systems, web development, and more.

                    I built a Python-based voice agent pipeline using Azure STT/TTS, GPT, and Retrieval-Augmented
                    Generation over Azure AI Search to prototype a generative AI system for IT Helpdesk requests. The
                    project explored how voice and agentic AI could reduce manual routing latency and improve task
                    automation across internal support systems.

                    At Aqualab, I developed <a href="blogs/splash.html">Splashv2</a>, a large-scale traceroute ingestion pipeline using Dagster, Docker
                    Compose, ClickHouse, and Grafana. The system reduced setup time from days to under an hour and
                    processed 1.6M+ RIPE Atlas traceroutes in under an hour while accelerating geolocation by 86%
                    through multi-core parallelization.

                    I worked on a peer-to-peer data processing platform built with libp2p, implementing localization to
                    parse UWB sensor data into (x, y, z) coordinates. This contributed to a system that enables
                    distributed tracking across privacy-preserving devices.

                    I engineered a low-latency LED control system in C to study firefly synchronization. The setup
                    achieved sub-5ms latency via a UDP pipeline between a laptop and a Raspberry Pi, allowing for
                    precise real-time behavioral analysis in swarm experiments.
